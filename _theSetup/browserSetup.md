All things you need to mess with "about:config" to turn on.

* Json Data

Best thing is these work on the phone version of Firefox as well.

### Browsers

* One browser not locked down for webmail, shopping, etc
    * Safari or Firefox Developer Edition
    * [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)
* One brwoser locked down for normal surfing
    * Firefox
* One sacrificial browser for stuff that does not work in the locked down one
    * Chrome
